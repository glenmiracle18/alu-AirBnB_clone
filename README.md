# AIRBNB CLONE PROJECT

This is an attempt at making a clone of the AIRBNB web-app. On this project in particular we focus on the back-end console, in charge of manipulating our storage system.



# The console

Our console is made up of a series of linux codes that act as interface while we haven't developed the front end of our web-app.
